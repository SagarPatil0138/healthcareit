<h3>Market Definition</h3>
<p>Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD) is a medical condition where the body produces insufficient amounts of growth hormone, leading to stunted growth, developmental issues, and other health complications. This deficiency can occur in both children and adults, with varied causes ranging from genetic disorders to hypothalamic or pituitary dysfunction. Treatment for GHD typically involves the administration of synthetic growth hormone to stimulate growth and regulate metabolic functions. The market for growth hormone therapies is driven by advancements in biotechnology, the increasing prevalence of GHD, and the rising awareness about treatment options.</p>
